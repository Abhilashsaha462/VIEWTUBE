# ViewTube

### Develop a Navigable SPA using Angular Routing

### Context - ViewTube

The ViewTube - an OTT application, is designed two types of users:​

1. One set of users who are all keen on viewing the videos over this OTT platform.​
2. The second set of users who are interested in creating and publishing their own videos  or even schedule live events over this OTT platform.​

The application is expected to provide different views to the users to avail these features.

### Problem

By the end of Phase – 3, ViewTube is ready with three views:

1. Landing View :: Providing list of videos to users

2. Studio View :: Allowing users to upload video

3. Studio View :: Allowing users to create live streams

However, all the three views are currently discrete and need to integrated.

The user should be allowed to navigate to the desired view.

The application should also allow viewers to watch the video of their choice.


### Instructions

1. This practice is in continuation to the Sprint 3 practice

2. Extend the Sprint 3 practice solution to add the stated requirements
